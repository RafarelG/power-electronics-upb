# DIODE CHARACTERISTICS

ItÂ´s a two-terminal pn-junctions device. When the potential between anode and cathode is positive taking the anode like the reference point, the diode is forward biased and conducts, in this moment the diode has a relatively small forward voltage drop across it. In other case, when the potential between anode and cathode is negative taking the anode like the reference point, the diode is reverse biased, in this situation a small reverse current (leakage current) flows and that current increases slowly in magnitude with the reverse voltage. This behavior can be observed in this image
